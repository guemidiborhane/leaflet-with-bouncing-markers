leaflet-with-bouncing-markers
=========

(at least the name is clear ^_^)
A fork of [leaflet.bouncemarker](https://github.com/maximeh/leaflet.bouncemarker) and just adds the ability to import it instead of the default leaflet

## Installation
[Leaflet](https://github.com/Leaflet/Leaflet) is **NOT** included by default so you can install the latest version directly

```sh
    npm install --save leaflet leaflet-with-bouncing-markers
    # or using Yarn
    yarn add leaflet leaflet-with-bouncing-markers
```


## Documentation
Head to the original [repo](bouncemarker) for the documentation about how to use the api after importing it

```js
    import Leaflet from 'leaflet-with-bouncing-markers';
    // Instead of
    import Leaflet from 'leaflet';
```
